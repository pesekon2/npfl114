### Assignment: dcgan
#### Date: Deadline: May 19, 23:59
#### Points: 1 points

This task is a continuation of [`gan`](#gan) assignment, which you will modify to
implement the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN).

Start with the
[dcgan.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/dcgan.py)
template and implement a DCGAN. Note that most of the TODO notes are from
the [`gan`](#gan) assignment.

After submitting the assignment to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`mnist`, `mnist-fashion`, and `mnist-cifarcars`). However,
note that you will need _a lot_ of computational power (preferably a GPU) to
generate the images.
