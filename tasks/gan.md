#### Date: Deadline: May 19, 23:59
#### Points: 3 points

In this assignment you will implement a simple Generative Adversarion Network
for three datasets in the MNIST format. Your goal is to modify the
[gan.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/gan.py)
template and implement a GAN.

After submitting the assignment to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`mnist`, `mnist-fashion`, and `mnist-cifarcars`) and
maybe try different latent variable dimensionality. The generated images are
available in TensorBoard logs.

You can also continue with [`dcgan`](#dcgan) assignment.
