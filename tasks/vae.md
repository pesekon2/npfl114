### Assignment: vae
#### Date: Deadline: May 19, 23:59
#### Points: 3 points

In this assignment you will implement a simple Variational Autoencoder
for three datasets in the MNIST format. Your goal is to modify the
[vae.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/10/vae.py)
template and implement a VAE.

After submitting the assignment to ReCodEx, you can experiment with the three
available datasets (`mnist`, `mnist-fashion`, and `mnist-cifarcars`) and
different latent variable dimensionality (`z_dim=2` and `z_dim=100`).
The generated images are available in TensorBoard logs.
